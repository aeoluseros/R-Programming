This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

{r,echo=FALSE}
```{r,echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```     

{r,cache=FALSE}
```{r,cache=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```   

{r,eval=FALSE}
```{r,eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```   

{r,results='hide'}
```{r,results='hide'}
summary(cars)
```   

You can also embed plots, for example:

{r, echo=FALSE}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Modify the format a little bit:

{r, fig.width=7,fig.height=6}

```{r, fig.width=7,fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
